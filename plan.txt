The time to renovate my room has finally come. 
After a few hours of designing, I can present my plan. 
First, I have to sort my belongings and remove all furniture. 
Luckily, I have free room next door, where I can store it all during renovation. 
Once my space will be clean, I can start tearing off the floor. 
Next, I am going to paint the walls, which are currently just white. 
I have opted for ice blue and pineapple delight as the main colours of the opposite walls. 
Once the paint is dry, I will begin to install grey laminate flooring with underlay beneath planks. 
By the time I finish, new bed, desk and dresser should arrive. 
Two last things I will have to do then, will be to assemble the furniture and arrange my things left in the next rooms. 
In the end, all I will have to do is to clean my room.
